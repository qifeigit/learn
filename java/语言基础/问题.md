**ClassNotFoundException** is an exception that occurs when you try to load a class at run time using **Class.forName()** or **loadClass()** methods and mentioned classes are not found in the classpath.

**NoClassDefFoundError** is an error that occurs when a particular class is present at compile time, but was missing at run time.
