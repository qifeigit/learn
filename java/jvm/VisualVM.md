# Java VisualVM - Browsing a Heap Dump

You can use Java VisualVM to browse the contents of a heap dump file and quickly see the allocated objects in the heap. Heap dumps are displayed in the heap dump sub-tab in the main window. You can open binary format heap dump files (`.hprof`) saved on your local system or use Java VisualVM to take heap dumps of running applications.
